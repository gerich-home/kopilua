        Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">Kopi Lua is a C# port of the Lua v.5.1.4 
        virtual machine, parser, libraries and command-line utilities. KL is <i>not</i> 
        simply an 
        interface to a compiled DLL, all original code has been ported over to managed C#.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">Please note that this is an alpha release only. 
        I&#39;ve tested it against numerous test samples and it seems to mostly hold up as 
        well as the x86 C implementation upon which it was based. That said, I&#39;m sure 
        there are many bugs lurking within, so if you encounter any then please
        let me know. Bear in mind that managed environments are notoriously restrictive, so I&#39;m 
        sure the VM can be forcibly crashed without too much trouble. The code has not 
        been subjected to rigorous scrutiny and is by no means meant to be regarded 
        as secure in its current state.</font></p>

    <h3 class="western">
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">Projects and Solutions</font></h3>
    <p class="western">
        Kopi Lua provides a project file for Microsoft Visual C# 2008 Express Edition 
        containing three solutions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p class="western">
                <i>KopiLua</i> is a class library containing the port of the core Lua VM and parser.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="western">
                <i>Lua</i> is a Windows console application port of the Lua 5.1.4 interpreter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="western">
                <i>Luac</i> is a Windows console application port of the Lua 5.1.4 compiler.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="western">
        Note that although the KopiLua solution compiles into a DLL, the source files 
        have also been added to Lua and Luac so that they produce standalone 
        executables. At this time all projects containing the Lua core files must be compiled with the following 
        compilation flags, 
        changing them will break the compile:</p>
    <p class="western">
        LUA_CORE;_WIN32;LUA_COMPAT_VARARG;LUA_COMPAT_MOD;LUA_COMPAT_GFIND;CATCH_EXCEPTIONS</p>
    <p class="western">
        The only new flag is CATCH_EXCEPTIONS and this is the one flag that can be safely disabled. When 
        the Lua VM encounters an error it typically breaks out of execution with a long jump, 
        although this can be changed to throw an exception in C++ builds. The C# port 
        also throws exceptions and catches them higher up the execution heirarchy, but 
        the catch is only done when 
        CATCH_EXCEPTIONS is specified during the build. In general, this is the desired behavior, but 
        turning it off can make it easier to track down exceptions in the code while debugging 
        the VM code.</p>
    <h3 class="western">
        Known Issues</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
    <p class="western">
        There is currently no support for locale.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p class="western">
        There are several  differences in the behaviour of calls to operating 
        system functions, particularly with undefined operations e.g. renaming an open file works in C but 
        throws an exception in C#.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p class="western">
        The
        strftime() function has not yet been ported, so os_date() currently has 
        an incomplete implementation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <p class="western">
        The handling of
        lua_str2number() errors is a bit of a hack job at the moment. If the number being 
        converted is outside the allowable range then the function is supposed to return 
        either positive or negative infinity. The current code will return the correct 
        value in most non-pathological cases but it needs additional work to make it more 
        robust.</p>
      </li>
        <li>
            <p class="western">
                Memory allocation and tracking has not been properly implemented with user data objects so 
                the behaviour of the garbage collector won&#39;t be 100% identical to the C version 
                when user data objects are in use. This is currently high on the list of things to be 
                fixed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="western">
        Porting Notes</h3>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">The primary goal of KL was for the port to match 
        the behaviour of the C code as closely as possible. A secondary goal was to 
        maintain a code base that is as close to the original C version as possible in order to 
        assist with future version upgrades and patches.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">The C code has been modified to remove all 
        structs with the exception of Value; all other objects are passed  by 
        reference. This was done to assist in a future port to Java and/or any other 
        languages that don&#39;t support passing objects via the stack. At some point the KL 
        code will be modified so that Value is implemented with a class as well.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">The project currently does not employ the use of 
        any pre-processor, so all function #defines etc have been implemented by 
        expanding them out to  full-bodied functions. This will be changed in future as 
        it obviously has a negative effect on performance.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">The original source is littered with C-style 
        conditionals of the form “if (val)” where val is a pointer or integer variable. 
        These have all been expanded out to their explicit forms i.e. “if (val != 0)” etc.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">There is a significant amount of mixing of 16-bit/32-bit 
        and signed/unsigned arithmetic; in most cases a simple cast was enough to fix this. It will, 
        however, need to be cleaned up at some point as it may be having an effect on performance.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">The C code makes judicious use of pointer 
        arithmetic, which presented a particularly challenging technical difficulty. 
        When KL creates or resizes an array it loops through every element and stores a 
        pointer to the array  as well as it&#39;s position index within it. Overloaded operators are then used to 
        reference neighbouring elements. 
        Similarly, statements that use indirection such as “*s” etc have been converted 
        to array look-ups of the form “s[0]”. In certain cases the code works with 
        pointer pointers (e.g. GCObject **), this was solved by creating an intermediate 
        class to represent a pointer-to-array (i.e. CGObjectRef).</font></p>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">The handling of strings is a very specific 
        example of arrays that needed to be solved with a custom object (CharPtr) which 
        stores a pointer to the char array and an offset into that array. Operator 
        overloading then allows for the code to work with the string similar to the way 
        in which the original code works with the char *. One notable difference here is 
        the fact that in the original C code a char * passed to a function resides on 
        the stack, so the function can change it at will. In KL the CharPtr object is a 
        reference, so if any changes to the index itself are made then a local copy of 
        the CharPtr has to be made first so that the object passed in by the calling 
        function isn&#39;t corrupted. Chars are stored internally as Unicode but are treated 
        as ASCII when converting to and from their byte representations i.e. the source 
        code uses Unicode chars but from the perspective of the Lua scripts all strings 
        appear as ASCII.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">Several variables in the C code use C# reserved 
        words, notably “base” and “ref”. These have been post-fixed with an underscore 
        i.e. “base_” and “ref_”.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">In order for KL to behave exactly in the same way 
        as the original code the Lua garbage collector needed to be ported as well. This 
        is particularly important for the behaviour of things such as weak tables etc. 
        This presented a few problems, however, since the garbage collector relies on 
        the total size of allocated objects, and generally speaking the “size” of a 
        class is a meaningless concept in managed environments like C#. In order to get 
        around this the memory allocation routines have been hard-coded with the size of 
        all objects in the original C code. This is used to ensure that the value of the 
        totalbytes member in global_State behaves identically to its C counterpart, 
        which in turn ensures that the garbage collector behaves the same as well (an 
        obvious downside is that this value is no longer an accurate representation of 
        the true number of bytes allocated). When the Lua garbage collector frees an 
        object it simply releases all handles to it and allows the C# garbage collector 
        to then truly free the object as and when it chooses.</font></p>
    <p>
        The Lua source code calls a lot of standard C functions (memcpy, gets, ungetc, 
        fopen etc, to name a few). C# implementations for all of these have been 
        developed and added to the bottom of the luaconf.cs file.</p>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">The most challenging problem by far was 
        overcoming the C code&#39;s use of unions. Unions of the type used by the Lua code 
        are not possible in managed code so a variety of tricks were employed to remove 
        them. In cases where unions are used to save memory (e.g. Value) the union 
        itself was unecessary and the members were simply added to a regular class. In 
        some cases, e.g. the Closure class, a common header was added to the members 
        CClosure and LClosure and casting was used depending on the closure type; this 
        has been implemented by seperating the header out into a seperate class 
        (ClosureHeader), adding a pointer to it to both the CClosure and LClosure 
        members and using inherited operator overloading so that they can be “cast” to 
        the ClosureHeader type.</font></p>
    <p>
        <font face="Arial, sans-serif">There were many language-specific 
        features in the code that caused problems such as using typed enums with ints, using fall-through in 
        switch statements, failing to break from default handlers in switch statements, 
        using commas to seperate statements, using “0” to represent NULL etc. In general 
        though, the KL code follows the original C code very closely and shouldn&#39;t be 
        too difficult to work with if you&#39;re familiar with the original code 
        base.</font></p>
